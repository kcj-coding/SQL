-- The correct SQL operation order is FROM (and JOIN), WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT and ORDER BY
-- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. To use HAVING it must be preceeded by a GROUP BY clause

-- FACT tables expand vertically (more rows than columns, concatenated key) DIMENSION tables expand horizontally (more columns than rows, primary key)

LAG(c.age,1,0) OVER(ORDER BY o.order_id) as prv_age, -- window function to show previous entry

-- You cannot join on unique primary key when selecting more than 1 row of returned rows from SELECTION, this will cause an error

-- If specifying a type e.g. c.age as integer, age must be a number otherwise the execution of the query will error
